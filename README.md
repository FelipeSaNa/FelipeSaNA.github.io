I have participated in multiple projects and initiatives ranging from various topics including 

## Data Analysis projects as part of the International Organization on Migration (IOM) 

As part of my work at the International Organization on Migration (Mexico), I have been in charge of the collection, cleaning and data analysis of the  statistical information on the cases arriving at the Protection Unit in the 7 IOM offices where the unit has a presence (Tapachula, Mexico City, Monterrey, Ciudad Juárez, Tenosique, Mexicali, Tijuana). The information is cleaned, merged, and analyzed monthly using the R programming langauge to ensure its quality and accesibility.

To ensure the 

### Data visualization pipeline

Generated two interactive dashboards (Power-BI) based on case analysis and statistical information visualization of the information collected by the protection unit.

## Report on displacement

Co-designed, co-coordinated, and co-implemented a research project regarding the internally displaced persons, returnees, and migrants arriving at 12 points of interest in the northern Mexican border. For the project, a sample of 638 migrants (including information on their 1142 family members) was collected
using KOBO toolbox. The data was cleaned and analyzed with the R programming language for a report (published in July 2023).

## Data Analysis projects as part of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 

Designed, supervised, and implemented a research project to analyze the racial profiling conducts of the Mexican Government in airports against asylum seekers and migrants. Obtained five governmental databases (from 2017 to 2021) of in-airport deportations. The databases were cleaned, merged, and analyzed through the R programming language. Conducted 60 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (NGOs, International Organizations, Embassies, and Immigrants). Interviews were later compiled, classified in a database, and analyzed with Natural Language Processing tools in R programming language.



## Data Analysis projects as part of México Unido Contra la Delincuencia 

### Homicides report

Obtained, cleaned, merged, and analyzed historical databases of crimes committed in Mexico from 1990 to 2021, with 1,954,282 observations. The data were georeferenced at the municipality or locality level. The databases were updated monthly, and the analysis results were published in a monthly bulletin and an annual research report.

### Drug confiscations database and dashboard

Obtained, cleaned, and analyzed a governmental database of 918,468 observations of the actions implemented by the Mexican Government regarding drug confiscations between 1990 and 2021 using the R programming language.

## Data Analysis projects as part of Elementa DDHH

Created an interactive network of more than 150 relevant actors and their relationships regarding the Mexico-United States drug policy with the R programming language (tidyverse, visNetwork, and igraph packages).

## Research projects

As part of my work I have also created projects which purpose is to advance the academic literature of migration/refugees policies implementation through data analysis. As part of this effort I have written papers and book chapters outlining different aspects of policy implementation.

## For fun projects

Created a simple platforming game in Javascript with a character drawn by my wife. The purpose was testing my basic Javscript programming skills. You can play it below!
